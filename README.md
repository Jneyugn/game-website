## 🚀 Purpose of the Project  
The website is designed to cater to a general audience with an interest in gaming. Its primary goal is to provide a space where users can engage with others by seeking advice or offering tips on games they are currently playing. While similar to Reddit in its functionality, this platform will focus exclusively on gaming content, making it a go-to resource for gamers looking to connect, seek advice, or offer guidance on a wide variety of games. This specialized focus fosters a more targeted, community-driven environment, promoting both learning and engagement within the gaming community.


- **Audience**: Our target audience includes anyone who loves games or is interested in gaming, from casual players exploring new titles to dedicated enthusiasts sharing strategies. 

The platform welcomes individuals of all skill levels and fosters a community for those passionate about engaging with gaming content.
